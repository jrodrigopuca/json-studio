      Build-only HTML entry for the extension viewer.
      Vite 7 requires an HTML entry with top-level component usage to
      properly extract CSS Modules. This file references main.tsx (which
      renders <App /> at the top level) instead of init.tsx directly.
      This HTML file is NOT included in the extension output.
